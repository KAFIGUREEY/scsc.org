      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Somali Community Solidarity Centre (SCSC) is a registered Non-Governmental Organization working in FGS/FMS. 
        The organization was established in 2020 and registered by the federal government and federal member states, 
        concerned about the poor and deteriorating humanitarian conditions of Somali people who have endured nearly 
        two decades of continuous and incessant conflicts, droughts, floods and political upheavals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The organization was established as a venue and tool to support and raise awareness for the destitute and 
        deprived people of all FGS/FMS Somalia affected by prolonged conflict and without access to basic services 
        such as health, education, agriculture infrastructures and development. SCSC Somalia is committed in 
        providing livelihood, health, protection services, and also runs human rights programs that regularly 
        engage duty bearers and right holders. The organization has its headquarters in Mogadishu and Afgoye Town 
        of Southwest.
